------- Dimensionalty Reduction of Population Data -------

 - Program to be run after build with command:

	project dfnc.txt

 - Program output .txt file can then be uploaded for 
   visualization at either or both of: 

	http://phylo.io/

	https://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi

 - Alternatively, both outputs are saved to .svg files
   and included in the .zip

 - As an additional alternative, both are temporarily
   stored at their respective websites via direct links:

	http://phylo.io/#61b713b87f711223e7ab99c9b1caa58c
	(will require Rescaling and zooming via controls)

Additional info:

dfnc.txt is a slightly modified version of the original 
dataset that is used by this program.

Original dataset also included as a .xls and can
be downloaded from https://strbase.nist.gov//dogSTRs.htm
for verification, if needed.

Newick outputs make use of commas, and therefore can not
be present in breed names and needed to be removed.

To convert the original .xls file for use, if desired, 
find and remove all commas and re-save as a 
tab-separated file.

Current build included in zip file.
