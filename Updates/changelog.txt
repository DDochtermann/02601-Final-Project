-------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- v 1.0 ---------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
------- Converting dataset file to workable Go struct -------
-------------------------------------------------------------

ADDED STRUCT:
	Pup

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	GeneratePupMatrix
	ReadFileLines
	HeadersToLocusNames
	GetNextPup

NOTES:	
* Modified input file requirements from comma to tab delimited
as comma delimited line splitting broke the program when breed 
names contained commas (ex: "Poodle, Standard)

--------------------------- v 1.1 ---------------------------

Notes:
* Offloaded linesplitting from GeneratePupMatrix into 
HeadersToLocusNames
* Added general input/output comments to each function
* Tested and verified succesful data conversion

-------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- v 2.0 ---------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
---------- Performing Principal Component Analysis ----------
-------------------------------------------------------------

ADDED TYPE:
	DataMatrix

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	Create2DMatrix
	TransposeMatrix
	MultiplyMatrix
	DotProduct
	SumArray
	PrintMatrix
	TruncateMatrix

NOTES:
* First PCA output generated but not yet visualized
* GeneratePupMatrix modified to now flow into Create2DMatrix,
now returning a DataMatrix instead of []Pup

--------------------------- v 2.1 ---------------------------

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	MatrixToCSV

NOTES:
* PCA output now plottable in excel via MatrixToCSV output, 
demonstrating that normalization of the data is required 
before processing
* Added comments to all functions added after v 2.0

--------------------------- v 2.2 ---------------------------

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	PCA

NOTES:
* Moved PCA sub-function calls into a primary function PCA, to 
simplify the code within main
* PCA dimensions now taken as command line input
* Simplified console outputs on input errors easier so they
are easier to fix
* Updated comments on GeneratePupMatrix to reflect the changes
made in V 2.0

--------------------------- v 2.3 ---------------------------

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	NormalizeMatrix
	GetNormVars
	Normalize
	
NOTES: 
* Tried normalizing values from -1 to 1 first, but had better
results when normalizing around the avg and stdev
* Commented all relevant functions, added normalization
to the many calls PCA makes. Now capable of calling PCA
on a cluster ouptut if attempted in future versions
* Commented all functions

-------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- v 3.0 ---------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
-------- Applying Mean Shift Clustering to PCA Output -------
-------------------------------------------------------------

ADDED TYPE:
	ClusterSet

ADDED STRUCT:
	Position

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	CreateClusters
	MeanShift
	CleanUp
	AvgPos
	FindInRange
	Pow10
	MinMax
	ClustersToCSV

--------------------------- v 3.1 ---------------------------

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	MeanShiftAndCluster
	SplitToMatrices
	Closest Cluster

NOTES: 
* Modified Cleanup to remove clusters that are practically 
the same
* Meanshift now returns the firstNonNull value, so cleanUp 
can start with that rather than 0 arbitrarily
* All above functions now called within MeanShiftAndCluster
* Converted MeanShift to C method for memory conservation
* Output clustered data to excel to plot and collect pngs for 
visualization

--------------------------- v 3.2 ---------------------------

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	RecursiveBreakdown

NOTES:
* Now pass FinalTags alongside FinalSets to identify prior
heirarchy for heirarchal clustering
* Added function comments
* Added ids to Pup type to identify for heirarchal clustering


-------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- v 4.0 ---------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
----------- Regrouping and Reorganizing for Output-----------
-------------------------------------------------------------

ADDED STRUCT:
	TagInfo

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	AHC
	HeirarchalCluster
	GetMaxDepth
	GetSetsAtDepths
	GetTagInfo
	
NOTES:
* Currently functions simply group all input clusters based
on their assigned depth from the recursive mean sort, to
make sure that the new struct and all loops function right
* Will be modified in future to return heirarchal data
* Neglecting function comments for now as all of the
above functions will likely change

--------------------------- v 4.1 ---------------------------

NOTES:
* Verified a few more components with even more print
statements to the console
* Removed the rest of the print line checks throughout
* Passed dims into AHC and HeirarchalCluster to allow
for 3-Dimensional check

--------------------------- v 4.2 ---------------------------

ADDED GLOBAL VARIABLE:
	NewickString

ADDED STRUCT:
	Node

ADDED TYPE:
	Tree

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	PrintTreeToNewick
	MakeAndPrintMaps
	PrintOneMap
	NewickToTXT
	AddNode
	
NOTES:
* Made use of Trees to store infomration on all clusters,
including their roots and children
* Made use of the Newick format for tree plotting via online
tools
* Realized that comma's are important in the Newick format, 
so the original dataset was modified to remove them and 
saved to DFNC.txt (DogFilerNoCommas)
* Looking at that output brought to light a few things:
* Pimarily that Heirarchal Clustering would possibly make
sense to do if was performed on the Final Set of clusters, 
running on each cluster and subclusters is pointless
* This may be accurate, as STR repeats were inconsistent 
across breeds in the source dataset

-------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- v 5.0 ---------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------ Cleaning Up ------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------

REMOVED FUNCTION:
	Pow10

NOTES:
* Removed the dimensions from the default list of command
line arguments, as 3D will almost always return a better 
result
* Now "testmode" can be called in place of the filename,
allowing for custom dimensions, output file, maximum
cluster size used for PCA and clustering, and Newick outfile
* Edited comments to better reflect updates, added comments
where none previously existed
* Moved functions around to better reflect call order

-------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- v 6.0 ---------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
------------- Implementing Heirarchal Clustering ------------
-------------------------------------------------------------

ADDED FUNCTIONS:
	MakeStringForHCLabel
	DMtoPos
	GroupNodes
	FindClosestClusters
	CalcDistance
	CalcScoreAndWeight

NOTES:
* Previous test outputs demonstrated the need for Heirarchal
Clustering on the final sets returned from the algorithms
utilized prior

--------------------------- v 6.1 ---------------------------

FUNCTIONS REMOVED:
	AddNode
	GetMaxDepth
	GetSetsAtDepths
	AHC
	PrintMSTreeToNewick
	MakeAndPrintMap
	PrintOneMap
	
NOTES: 
* Multiple functions and all associated variables, structs, 
and datatypes used were removed where unneccessary
* These functions were either used for test data output, or
were previously intended for use in AHC, wherein more 
efficient methods were found and utilized


--------------------------- v 6.2 ---------------------------
-------------------------- (Final) --------------------------

NOTES:
* Final pass of general organizational revision
* Assured variable names were consistent and made sense
* Added comments within functions where concepts may not
be perfectly clear
* Removed unneccesary newlines and commented out print
statements used in previous iterations for verification
* Modified print statements to console
* Added a run complete messege at program completion
